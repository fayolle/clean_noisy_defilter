# Reverse image filtering with clean and noisy filters 
A simple implementation in MATLAB of this [paper]() on reverse image filtering noisy filters. 

## Notes 
The file 'test.m' contains a simple test for defiltering a noisy motion blurred image. The file 'Landweber.m' contains an implementation of the main approach described in the paper. The files 'PC_Landweber.m' and 'NA_Landweber.m' contain accelerated variants (described in the paper as well).
